Thoughts post read. 
1. The importance of the history and the tradition
2. Jinping as trying to solve the worst contradictions of the Maoist and Dengist eras: a middle path.
3. The spiritual question in Chinese politics
4. The necessity of a ‘centre’ in Chinese politics
5. ‘Biological transition event’ as Xi Jinping’s preoccupation?

If we read this biography through the lens of Jinping’s obsession with history (drawing on the lessons of the Soviet Union), the events seem terribly consequential in a way that recent political history in the west simply is not. China will continue to make sense of itself in terms of its own history. 

Torigian’s books seems to suggest the importance of the combination of the “reformist” Third Plenum and the “conservative” Four Cardinal Principles. Xi appears to be absolutely committed to both. 

Deng has an autocratic leadership style, contrasted with the ‘united front’, inner party democracy style of Xi.

Zhu Jiamu & Jinping

The spiritual question is at the heart of Chinese politics… the material will not be had at the expense of the spiritual. The party must remain a spiritual centre for Chinese political and cultural life.

— First thoughts

What is most interesting to me is the personal dimension, what Torigian describes as the conflict between ‘partyness’ and ‘humanness’. 

What fits into this? The creation of new people (fashioning screws), humiliating self-criticism, the spiritual dimension of the party,…

The key fact is that Xi is purged in 1962 on account of a novel. I should figure out the story here.

Five themes
1. Ideology
2. Communism as a global phenomenon
3. Relations with ethnic minorities
4. Succession politics
5. Young people
___
## Ideology
Born Shanxi province, 1913, where Qin Shi Huang establishes first unified state. In a milieu of radicalism, but with individualistic and romantic strains. 1927 end of first united front, when Chiang Kai Shek decides to massacre the communists. Inspired by Zhang Guang Zhi’s *The Young Wanderer*. Difference in tactics, overlayed with ideological charge, leads young Xi to be thrown in prision.

Purged in 1962 on account of a novel.

In 1978 we have the contradiction between ‘the 3 and the 4’, the 3rd plenum (economic modernization > class struggle), and the 4 cardinal principles (ideological orthodoxy).

1980-81, the *Bitter Love* comes under first, a movie which sees an intellectual loyal to the party being persecuted on his return to China during the Cultural Revolution.

> “You always loved the party, but did the party ever really love you?”

1987 Hu Yaobang, Xi’s boss at the secretariat is removed from power.

___
## Global Communism
1950s the peak of Soviet cooperation and city planning. 

1959 Xi Zhongxun is in Moscow, during the Sino-Indian border conflict. The Soviets release a neutral statement, despite their formal alliance with China.

> (Mao, to Khrushchev) Your statement made the imperialists happy.

Zhongxun in 1990, writing for People’s Daily

> Only the Chinese communists… could find the correct road to socialism for China through combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China’s revolutionary practice.

It is a fact that the Soviet union fractured along ethnic lines. This was not lost on the Chinese, by any means.
___
## Ethnic relations
Xi is a ‘united front guy’. The 1980s is a time for experimentation in ethnic politics.
___
## Succession
Xi is ‘chief deputy to the chief deputy’, twice. In the 80s it is to Hu Yaobang, who ends up on the wrong side of Deng in the matter of succession: he support’s Deng’s intention to resign.
___
## The Youth

It comes to a head in 1989, when students protest after the death of Hu Yaobang. Despite his inclination toward a conciliatory approach to the protests, he swings in behind marshal law. He suffers an emotional episode and decides to move to the south.

___
# Intellectual history
Wang Huning, the ideological czar in Beijing.

Mao is regarded (by himself and academic Lieu Xiaofeng) as a philosopher-king. 

See Mitchell (2020) on reception of Schmitt in China.

___
___

1998, Liu Xiaofend publishes “Carl Schmitt and the Predicament of Liberal Constitutionalism”, as a response to McCormick’s book. Liu writes a series of lectures on *Carl Schmitt and Political Law*.
