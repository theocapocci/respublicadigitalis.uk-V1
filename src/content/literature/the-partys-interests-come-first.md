This is about Xi Zhongxun, but because the Chinese Communist Party is so central to his identity, it is also an exhilarating window into the history of this often opaque and difficult-to-understand institution. 

If there is a concept at the heart of the narrative, it is the distinction between  ‘partyness’ and ‘humanness’. The friction between these animates the telling of Xi’s deeply personal relationship to the party. Personable, somewhat of a ‘charmer’, with his own distinctive outlook on life, there can be no doubt that Zhongxun was his own man. His idiosyncrasies included a penchant for match-making which can only be described as mercilessly patriarchal. His son Jinping wrote of him in a birthday letter, ‘you never persecuted people, and you always maintained the truth while not speaking any falsehoods.’ Yet at the decisive moment, Zhongxun was also always a party man. Whatever his personal stance on a matter, he would subordinate his perspective to the higher goal of party unity. One of his most treasured possessions was a white cloth given to him by Chairman Mao, with the words ‘the party’s interests come first’. When he is purged by Mao in 1962, this prompts sixteen years of self-criticisms in which he attempts as best he can to reconcile himself to the charges. 

An aspect of Xi’s personal struggle is illuminated well by something he says towards the end of his life, following his political rehabilitation, that ‘it is also necessary to have a spiritual civilization’. We risk losing sight of the spiritual dimension of the party if we only speak of the material achievements of the CCP. Although it is not possible for us to speak of the spiritual achievements of the CCP *per se*, it is nonetheless the case that the party has in its history been endowed with existential significance. It cannot be reduced to a source of personal benefit for those which manage to climb its ranks. While a route to social advancement, it is also a spiritual entity. The balance between the material and the spiritual, which the party aims to strike is represented well by the tension between the “third” and the “fourth”.  While the Third Plenum marked the start of reform and (limited) liberalization, the conservative Four Cardinal Principles protect the ‘hard core’ of the party’s ideology. Chinese politics remains an attempt to chart a course between these poles. 

An important question raised by Torigian is whether this spiritual civilization can withstand generational turnover. During a visit to the Amana colonies as part of a delegation to the US, Xi’s American counterparts were surprised by the forfulness with which he was asking questions. The failure of this collectivist experiment, owing to a new generation who cared less for the principles upon which it was founded than the prospects afforded by a more materialist lifestyle, must have been a potent symbol of the danger posed by the young. In Torigian’s telling, a youth uninterested in ‘eating bitterness’, who had not endured the political depredations of the cultural revolution, let alone authentic revolutionary struggle, presents itself as a permanent threat to this spiritual civilization.

Thoughts post read. 
1. The importance of the history and the tradition
2. Jinping as trying to solve the worst contradictions of the Maoist and Dengist eras: a middle path.
3. The spiritual question in Chinese politics
4. The necessity of a ‘centre’ in Chinese politics
5. ‘Biological transition event’ as Xi Jinping’s preoccupation?

If we read this biography through the lens of Jinping’s obsession with history (drawing on the lessons of the Soviet Union), the events seem terribly consequential in a way that recent political history in the west simply is not. China will continue to make sense of itself in terms of its own history. 

Torigian’s books seems to suggest the importance of the combination of the “reformist” Third Plenum and the “conservative” Four Cardinal Principles. Xi appears to be absolutely committed to both. 

Deng has an autocratic leadership style, contrasted with the ‘united front’, inner party democracy style of Xi.

Zhu Jiamu & Jinping

The spiritual question is at the heart of Chinese politics… the material will not be had at the expense of the spiritual. The party must remain a spiritual centre for Chinese political and cultural life.

— First thoughts

What is most interesting to me is the personal dimension, what Torigian describes as the conflict between ‘partyness’ and ‘humanness’. 

What fits into this? The creation of new people (fashioning screws), humiliating self-criticism, the spiritual dimension of the party,…

The key fact is that Xi is purged in 1962 on account of a novel. I should figure out the story here. 



# Joseph Torigian at the Hoover Institute
Five themes
1. Ideology
2. Communism as a global phenomenon
3. Relations with ethnic minorities
4. Succession politics
5. Young people
___
## Ideology
Born Shanxi province, 1913, where Qin Shi Huang establishes first unified state. In a milieu of radicalism, but with individualistic and romantic strains. 1927 end of first united front, when Chiang Kai Shek decides to massacre the communists. Inspired by Zhang Guang Zhi’s *The Young Wanderer*. Difference in tactics, overlayed with ideological charge, leads young Xi to be thrown in prision.

Purged in 1962 on account of a novel.

In 1978 we have the contradiction between ‘the 3 and the 4’, the 3rd plenum (economic modernization > class struggle), and the 4 cardinal principles (ideological orthodoxy).

1980-81, the *Bitter Love* comes under first, a movie which sees an intellectual loyal to the party being persecuted on his return to China during the Cultural Revolution.

> “You always loved the party, but did the party ever really love you?”

1987 Hu Yaobang, Xi’s boss at the secretariat is removed from power.

___
## Global Communism
1950s the peak of Soviet cooperation and city planning. 

1959 Xi Zhongxun is in Moscow, during the Sino-Indian border conflict. The Soviets release a neutral statement, despite their formal alliance with China.

> (Mao, to Khrushchev) Your statement made the imperialists happy.

Zhongxun in 1990, writing for People’s Daily

> Only the Chinese communists… could find the correct road to socialism for China through combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with China’s revolutionary practice.

It is a fact that the Soviet union fractured along ethnic lines. This was not lost on the Chinese, by any means.
___
## Ethnic relations
Xi is a ‘united front guy’. The 1980s is a time for experimentation in ethnic politics.
___
## Succession
Xi is ‘chief deputy to the chief deputy’, twice. In the 80s it is to Hu Yaobang, who ends up on the wrong side of Deng in the matter of succession: he support’s Deng’s intention to resign.
___
## The Youth

It comes to a head in 1989, when students protest after the death of Hu Yaobang. Despite his inclination toward a conciliatory approach to the protests, he swings in behind marshal law. He suffers an emotional episode and decides to move to the south.

___
# Intellectual history
Wang Huning, the ideological czar in Beijing.

Mao is regarded (by himself and academic Lieu Xiaofeng) as a philosopher-king. 

See Mitchell (2020) on reception of Schmitt in China.

___
___

1998, Liu Xiaofend publishes “Carl Schmitt and the Predicament of Liberal Constitutionalism”, as a response to McCormick’s book. Liu writes a series of lectures on *Carl Schmitt and Political Law*.
