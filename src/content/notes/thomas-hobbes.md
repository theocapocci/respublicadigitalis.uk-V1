[[The Hobbesian question]]
___
*Introductory note* – as questions about national identity are asked more often, Hobbes seems a valuable conversation partner. For two main reasons: the resurgence of a concept of sovereignty within liberal nation-states, and the pursuit of a collective interpretation of these large groupings. The concept of the state has become somewhat blunted in the anglophone sphere, and the concept of sovereignty is sharpening in America….

Hobbes and liberalism bear a complex relationship to one another. Was Hobbes a liberal? Not in the prevailing sense of the term. This has not prevented certain authors from classifying him as such. Yet the question of whether Hobbes is a liberal is not *my* question. My question is whether liberalism needs Hobbes or, more precisely, whether liberalism would not benefit from engaging with the sage of Malmesbury.  There are a couple of reasons for thinking so. The first, most transparent reason, is the resurgence or sharpening of a concept of sovereignty in North America…The second reason is the need for a collective interpretation of the political community of the United Kingdom. Hobbes provides the resources to think in these terms. 

If we wish to speak of a nation, we must first provide an interpretation of that term. The nation is so very far from the *civitas*. Nor can we today make sense of it as a *state* in the Hobbesian usage. The nation is, however, a *commonwealth*. (The rest hinges on how we can unpack this term).

One forceful position says that Hobbes is not relevant for politics today, and it is an achievement to have moved on from questions of sovereignty and centralized power. Foucault, for instance bemoaned the focus of political theory on the figure of the sovereign, claiming that it was necessary to ‘cut off the head of the sovereign’ in political theory. Others, such as Paul Sagar, take him to be less relevant under conditions of commercial modernity. Hobbes, lacking a theory of commercial society, is inevitably of limited importance for the modern commercial republic.  In some ways, Hobbes proved better at home in the *International Relations* literature on the latter half of the 20th century. For instance, Morgenthau, Waltzer, etc.

Why might Hobbes be relevant today? I can think of two main reasons. The first is the development of an authoritarian position *vis-à-vis* the presidency in the USA. The second, which will require more explanation, is the idiosyncratic interpretation of the state in the anglophone world. This has left us without a representative concept: we are uncomfortable with *state* or *nation* as an interpretation of the community.

Tuck has a good book on the [[richard-tuck-the-state|distinction between sovereignty and government]]. This may help us to understand the anglophone interpretation of the state. But no doubt the Americans / British pluralists will be relevant also.

But we need to find other points of view to lay out if we are going to write anything vaguely argumentative.

What do I want to communicate? A more well-grounded picture of Hobbes than is in the general imagination, explore why Hobbes might be relevant to thinking about contemporary politics.

Let’s be more concrete. (1) post-war prosperity, (2) the crisis of the social state, (3) neo-liberalism as a response, (4) the end of neo-liberalism as a viable model, (5) is more liberalism the answer? No? Why not? (6) what is the connection to Hobbes?

Let’s consider (6) first. Hobbes becomes more important when the idea of centralized authority becomes more powerful. A lot of this is mistake, but the structure of political obligation becomes relevant. This leads to a nuanced story: sovereignty develops and ultimate authority is made to reside in the state. We are in a position where the state concept has died in that form. In particular, we do not have a concept of the state as locus of sovereign authority, because this died ‘on the pyre of the nation’ (ir.). But at the same time, an interpretation of sovereignty focusing on the sovereign person will also grow in strength. I think the UK will resist this, because its tradition is especially resistant to it: it has a sovereign who is *completely without democratic legitimacy*.

I am going to go about this in a slightly strange order, but I think considering the connections to Hobbes first will be productive. 
1. The concept of the state (Tuck’s interpretation of Hobbes)
2. The concept of the sovereign (Hont’s interpretation of Hobbes)

This, then, can be linked to the more general content regarding Hobbes.
1. Thomas Hobbes (1): The Sage from Malmesbury, regarding biographic and cultural dimensions of his life
2. Thomas Hobbes (2): A Mortal God Awakens! Re: his political thought.
3. An essay concerning the significance of Hobbes for the 21st century.

There are a few reasons why I think that Hobbes is worth discussing. We have grown up, those of us who are today citizens of western nations, during a period in which liberalism has had fantastic success. Following the great wars of the first half of the twentieth century, strong growth (what was the driver of this growth?) saw substantial improvements in the standard of living. Life was very different for my father’s generation than it had been for his father. (There are key narrative details we will need to fill out).
