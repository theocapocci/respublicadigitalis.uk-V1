Create timeline

    Please help me to create a webpage that is a chronologically ordered timeline (like a conventional blog). The idea is that it will provide an excerpt from a piece of content, whether this is a note or a book in my library. The reader will have the option to read more, taking them to the dedicated page. Or continue to scroll through the feed. 


Create library

    Please help me to create a webpage for my site which is a library. I have an obsidian valut which has a markdown file for each book. The title of the file is the book's citekey in zotero. The first step is to import these markdown files for the books into my website repository. We have done a similar thing already for my notes. The current workflow is to use the yaml frontmatter property dr-publish (true/false) in obsidian. If true, then file is sent to my website repository
    
     Please draw inspiration from https://maggieappleton.com/library. 



Send books to folder

    Please help me to sync my literature notes from my obsidian vault to my website. This should make use of sync-obsidian.js, which works in conjunction with a git action to push from my vault repo to my website repo. My books should be in the folder src/content/literature instead of src/content/notes. 


Other 

    Okay. Now that we have the literature notes in my website repo, let's begin creating the library webpage. When I publish a literature note, this should add to a library gallery organized in chronological order.
