Create timeline

    Please help me to create a webpage that is a chronologically ordered timeline (like a conventional blog). The idea is that it will provide an excerpt from a piece of content, whether this is a note or a book in my library. The reader will have the option to read more, taking them to the dedicated page. Or continue to scroll through the feed. 


Create library

    Please help me to create a webpage for my site which is a library. I have an obsidian valut which has a markdown file for each book. The title of the file is the book's citekey in zotero. The first step is to import these markdown files for the books into my website repository. We have done a similar thing already for my notes. The current workflow is to use the yaml frontmatter property dr-publish (true/false) in obsidian. If true, then file is sent to my website repository
